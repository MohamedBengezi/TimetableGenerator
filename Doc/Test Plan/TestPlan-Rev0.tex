% INTRODUCTION
\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
The goal of this project is to create a viable set of schedules for the user based on the inputted courses. All correcponding core's, labs, and tutorials must be included in each timetable. The automated testing shall include unit testing performed by the Mocha framework for javascript. Functional testing shall consist of input testing, along with conflict tests, and perfect input tests. Structural testing shall inlcude performance tests, such as a large number of courses as input, as well as dataset traversal tests. Fault and Mutation testing will occur throughout development. Manual testing, such as static testing, shall be done primarily by group code walkthrough's \& inspections, in order to check syntax and logic, and gain a better understanding of the program code as a whole. Dynamic testing shall include using a number of predetermined schedules from various programs, and using the courses on each schedule as input, and determining that each necessary core, lab, and tutorial are listed in the generated timetable. 

\subsection{Objectives}
This test plan will allow the team to head into the testing phase in an organized and informed manner, and with a clear goal in mind. These tests ensure that the product will be working as it should be when released for users. The plan will also ensure that testing is conducted properly, and any interested parties can learn about the testing of the product.\

\subsection{Software Description}
The program uses Node js for the backend, and HTML/CSS for the front end. The main modules in the program are the index.js module, which contains the code for the main page, the checkCourse.js module, which checks and  ensures all user inputs are valid and viable, the scheduler.js module, which is the main algorithm for creating the timetables, the Course.js module, which defines the course objects used throughout the program, and all the corresponding ejs files, which contain the HTML code for the front end of each page.

\subsection{Test Team}
The entire Genzter team will be in tasked with testing. Testing shall be evenly divided between members.

\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}
As stated above, automated testing will be done using the javascript testing framework called \href{http://mochajs.org}{Mocha}. Accompanying Mocha will be an assertion library called \href{http://chaijs.com/}{Chai}. Unit tests will be set up, and the framework will be used to automatically run through all the unit tests, and reveal any faults that may reside in the program. The unit tests will include normal input, boundary cases, as well as extreme cases and conflicting cases. This will ensure that the program functions expectedly, and that no special cases were missed. In other words, this automated testing approach will make sure that in any case, the program will have a path to follow, and its behaviour can be predicted.

\subsection{Testing Tools}
For unit testing we will be using the testing framework \href{http://mochajs.org}{Mocha}. System testing will be conducted on internet browsers. Code analysis will be done by the Genzter team.

\subsection{Testing Schedule}
The testing schedule is included in the Gantt chart, located in the Project Schedule folder in the main directory.

\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}\label{sec:compare}
The project will be benchmarked against two existing implementations, \url{http://timetablegenerator.io} and \url{https://github.com/ash47/TimetableGenerator}. Mainly, we will be comparing our project with \url{http://timetablegenerator.io} because it uses the McMaster database as well, so we can fully compare the generated timetables. The outputs are fairly similar, so comparison should not be very difficult. The comparison will be done manually by the testing team.
